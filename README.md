# üçï PizzaHut Sales Analysis Project

A data-driven project focused on analyzing PizzaHut‚Äôs sales performance using SQL. This analysis explores customer behavior, revenue patterns, and product popularity using real transactional data.

## üéØ Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to extract actionable insights from PizzaHut‚Äôs order data by performing structured SQL-based analysis. The project is divided into three levels of complexity:

- **Basic:** Track order volume, revenue, and best-selling pizzas.
- **Intermediate:** Understand ordering trends by time, category, and average daily sales.
- **Advanced:** Perform revenue breakdowns and cumulative sales tracking.

## üìÅ Dataset Overview

The analysis is based on four structured CSV files that represent different aspects of the PizzaHut ordering and product system:

1. **`order_details.csv`**  
   Contains information about each pizza ordered in every order.  
   - `order_details_id`: Unique identifier for each row  
   - `order_id`: ID linking to the overall order  
   - `pizza_id`: ID of the specific pizza  
   - `quantity`: Number of units ordered  

2. **`orders.csv`**  
   Captures the order-level information with timestamps.  
   - `order_id`: Unique identifier for each order  
   - `date`: Date the order was placed  
   - `time`: Time the order was placed  

3. **`pizza_types.csv`**  
   Contains descriptive information about pizza types.  
   - `pizza_type_id`: Identifier for the pizza type  
   - `name`: Name of the pizza  
   - `category`: Category of the pizza (e.g., Classic, Veggie, Chicken)  
   - `ingredients`: List of ingredients used  

4. **`pizzas.csv`**  
   Provides pricing and size details for each pizza variation.  
   - `pizza_id`: Unique identifier for a specific pizza (type + size)  
   - `pizza_type_id`: Link to the type of pizza  
   - `size`: Size of the pizza (e.g., S, M, L, XL)  
   - `price`: Price of the pizza

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies Used

### üîπ SQL (Structured Query Language)
- Core tool used for all data analysis tasks in the project.
- Performed complex data manipulations such as filtering, grouping, and sorting.
- Used various SQL operations including:
  - **JOINs** to combine data across multiple tables.
  - **GROUP BY** and **ORDER BY** to summarize and rank results.
  - **Aggregate functions** like `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()` to compute totals and averages.
  - **Window functions** for advanced analytics like cumulative revenue.
  - **Date and time functions** to analyze hourly and daily trends.
- Enabled effective transformation of raw sales data into meaningful business insights.
